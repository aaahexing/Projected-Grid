# Projected Grids #

It's a full **OpenGL** implementation of the famous 'projected grids' technique in ocean rendering.

The original concept comes out of Claes Johanson's master thesis which can be found [here](http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/graphics/theses/projects/projgrid/). 

All the methematics computations in this project are handled with the elegant mathematics library [GLM](https://github.com/Groovounet/glm).
